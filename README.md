A simple point-of-sale (POS) system built with Python for managing sales and inventory in a supermarket or retail environment. This project helps to streamline transactions, track stock levels, and generate reports.

## Features
- User authentication
- Product management (add, update, delete products)
- Sales tracking and invoicing
- Inventory management (monitor stock levels)
- Receipt generation
- Reports generation (daily, monthly, or yearly)
- Simple and intuitive interface

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language
- **Tkinter**: GUI library for creating the user interface
- **SQLite**: Database for storing product and sales data

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bashNavigate to the Project Directory:

cd pos-application

Install the Required Libraries: The application uses Python's built-in Tkinter and SQLite, so you don't need to install additional packages if you have Python set up on your machine.

Run the Application:

    python pos_application.py

    This will launch the POS application where you can start adding products, making sales, and generating reports.
